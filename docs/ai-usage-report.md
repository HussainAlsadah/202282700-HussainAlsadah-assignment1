# AI Usage Report

Project: 202282700-HussainAlsadah-assignment1

Date: 2026-02-13

Overview
--------
This document explains how AI tools were used while developing the assignment, what they were used for, the benefits and limitations observed, and how the AI outputs were reviewed and adapted.

Tools Used & Use Cases
----------------------
- ChatGPT (interactive assistant):
	- Assisted with CSS design ideas (color palettes, layout refinements, responsive approaches).
	- Generated JavaScript patterns (theme toggle, smooth scrolling, mobile nav toggle) and suggested accessible attributes.
	- Drafted documentation and suggested file organization and README content.
- GitHub Copilot (in-editor suggestions):
	- Provided small code completions and boilerplate snippets while writing CSS and HTML.

Benefits & Challenges
---------------------
- Benefits:
	- Speed: quickly produced patterns for responsive navigation and theme toggling.
	- Inspiration: suggested modern UI touches (gradients, subtle shadows, badges) that improved visual quality.
	- Documentation help: produced well-structured starting drafts for `docs/` files.
- Challenges / Limitations:
	- Output required review and contextual editing; AI suggestions were not always optimal or idiomatic for this project.
	- Some suggested external dependencies (fonts) were intentionally removed to keep the project self-contained.

Learning Outcomes
-----------------
- Improved ability to evaluate and adapt AI-generated code: verifying semantics, accessibility, and cross-browser behavior.
- Better understanding of responsive patterns for navigation and image handling.

Responsible Use & Modifications
-------------------------------
All AI-generated suggestions were reviewed and manually adapted as follows:
- Verified paths and assets exist and adjusted markup accordingly.
- Replaced external font imports with system font stacks to avoid external dependencies.
- Ensured ARIA attributes and keyboard accessibility for interactive controls.

Notes
-----
AI was used as an assistant, not an authoritative source. All final code was reviewed and edited manually to match the project requirements and to ensure academic integrity.
