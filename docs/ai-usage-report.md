Tools Used & Use Cases
----------------------
- ChatGPT :
	- Assisted in drafring and reviewing the initial mochup of the applicaiton.
    - Assisted in doing some tweaks and improvements towards the end of the development of the applicaiton.
- Claude :
    - Assisted in redesigning and adjusting main components of the application, in addition to giving some ideas of possible improvements.

overall I was altering between them depending on the responses and quality of the output that I am getting. 
	
Benefits & Challenges
---------------------
- Benefits:
	- Speed: quick and detailed responses allowed me to work on the application on a much faster pace than manually, in addition to providing a solid base template to modify and add to.
	- Inspiration: suggested modern UI touches (gradients, subtle shadows, badges) that improved visual quality.
    - Organization: helps with organizing the code and making it easier to read.
    - Documentation: assist to document projects substantially faster than normal, although needs someone to check on the output it gives
    - Testing: helps "to a small degree" in making sure that the application does what it needs to do.

- Challenges / Limitations:
	- many of the code drafts were incomplete and have missing features, lots of which needed manual testing and tweeking.
    - sometimes the LLM doesn't really understand the problem, instead it pretends to understand which inturn causes alot of downtime(wasted time), just to give up and manually fix it.
	

Learning Outcomes
-----------------
- Some minial adjustments to the interface can completely transform a page from being completely bland. such as using gradients, shadows, animations. which makes the page feel alot pleasing to the eye.
- extensive and detailed prompts are needed to get the desired result.

Responsible Use & Modifications
-------------------------------
I have manually reviewed AI-generated content as follows:
- I understood the code and manually changed values and texts as I saw fit.
- I have thoroughly tested the code and spotted many problems with it and modified/fixed them.
- I made sure that all the text represent what I would mean and manually changed/modified anywhere where I felt the AI doesn't express what I would want to convey/say.
