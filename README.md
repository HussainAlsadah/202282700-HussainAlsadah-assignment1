AI Usage (summary)
-------------------
I have used AI as a tools (ChatGPT and Claude) to generate code and gives recommendations and ideas that needs close attention to details, outputs needed manual review, testing, modifications. Significant changes were needed to fit my vision. for the texts I made sure that all of them reflect what I want to say and made as much changes as needed to reflect that on an honest scale.
See `docs/ai-usage-report.md` for details.
