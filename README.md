Run locally
-----------
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd 202282700-HussainAlsadah-assignment1
```

2. Open `index.html` in a browser (static site — no server required).

Files & Structure
-----------------
- `index.html` — main single-page markup
- `css/styles.css` — all styles (responsive rules, dark mode)
- `js/script.js` — smooth scrolling, theme toggle, mobile nav
- `assets/images/` — project placeholder images and other assets
- `docs/ai-usage-report.md` — AI usage report (draft)
- `docs/technical-documentation.md` — technical documentation (draft)

AI Usage (summary)
-------------------
AI tools (ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot) assisted in generating UI ideas, responsive navigation patterns, and drafting documentation. All AI suggestions were reviewed and adapted manually — see `docs/ai-usage-report.md` for details.

Notes
-----
- Contact form is client-side only (no backend).
- Test responsiveness with browser DevTools; the mobile nav appears at <=768px.

If you want, I can update the README with a live deployment link (GitHub Pages) or add persistent theme preferences (localStorage).
